Ruby has no kerberos binding for now. to solve this problem i wrote a ruby/c extension to retrieve Kerberos token for NetSoul authentication.

=Dependencies=
 * krb5 development header files
 * gssapi development header files

=Build the *NsToken* extension=
{{{
$ cd ./lib/kerberos
$ ruby extconf.rb
$ make
$ cd ../..
}}}

If no error ? All is right, you can put your unix_password directly in conf/config.yml or in RubySoul shell ([Documentation See documentation page]).

Have fun.
